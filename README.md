A tiny entity framework written in Java. It's inspired by frameworks like
[Ash](http://www.ashframework.org/) (hence the name) and
[Artemis](http://gamadu.com/artemis/). Ashley tries to be a high-performance
entity framework  without the use of black-magic and thus making the API easy
and transparent to use.

Ashley is awesome, if you don't believe it, check out some [games](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/wiki/Games-made-with-Ashley) made with it!

Ashley lives under the [Libgdx](https://github.com/libgdx) family but it does not force you to use that specific framework if you do not wish to do so.
